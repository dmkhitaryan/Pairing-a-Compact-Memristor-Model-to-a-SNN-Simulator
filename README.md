# Pairing a Compact Memristor Model to a Spiking Neural Network Simulator
## Abstract
As learning algorithms continue to expand in scale and complexity, their computational and energy demands become increasingly harder to meet. A potential solution to those problems is memristors: devices with the ability to “memorize” their resistance, even when the power supply is halted. Their properties could be leveraged to build low-energy profile neural networks. Previous research has explored this prospect by simulating a spiking neural network with Nb:STO-memristor-based synapses. Implemented within the Nengo framework and updating from local knowledge, its performance matched traditional neural networks. Here, a different memristor model is used to build a spiking neural network, after which the experiment was reproduced. The results were shown to be overall competitive with current learning algorithms, as well as the Nb:STO-memristor based solution, further solidifying the viability of memristive devices for computing purposes in the future.
